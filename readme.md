## Overview

This project leverages:
- *LangFlow* to design and deploy the agent's conversational workflow.
- *AstraDB* as a scalable and highly available database for data storage.
- *Gemini API* for advanced natural language understanding and data processing.

The combination of these tools enables seamless data retrieval and intelligent conversation handling.

---

## Features

- *Customizable Conversational Flow:* Easy-to-configure workflows using LangFlow.
- *Scalable Database Integration:* High-performance data storage and retrieval with AstraDB.
- *Intelligent Responses:* Powered by the Gemini API for natural language understanding and contextual awareness.

---

## Tech Stack

- *LangFlow:* Workflow builder for conversational agents
- *AstraDB:* NoSQL cloud-native database
- *Gemini API:* AI-powered NLP API

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- *LangFlow:* Installable via Python pip
- *AstraDB Account:* [Sign up for AstraDB](https://www.datastax.com/astra)
- *Gemini API Key:* Obtain from your Gemini account.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/langflow-astra-gemini-agent.git
cd langflow-astra-gemini-agent


### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root with the following content:

env
ASTRA_DB_ID=your_astra_db_id
ASTRA_DB_REGION=your_astra_db_region
ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE=your_keyspace_name
ASTRA_DB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
ASTRA_DB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key


### Step 3: Run LangFlow Server

Start the LangFlow server:

bash
langflow


Access the LangFlow UI at http://localhost:7860 to design and configure the conversational workflow.

### Step 4: Export the LangFlow Workflow

Once you have configured the workflow in the LangFlow UI:

1. Click the *Export* button in the LangFlow UI.
2. Save the exported workflow as a .flw file.
3. Convert the .flw file to JSON format.
4. Add the JSON file to the repository under the workflows/ directory.

---

## Usage

1. *Design Workflow:* Use the LangFlow UI to design the conversational agent's workflow.
2. *Store Data:* Add relevant data to AstraDB for retrieval during conversations.
3. *Integrate Gemini:* Ensure the Gemini API is integrated into the workflow for intelligent responses.
4. *Test Agent:* Interact with the agent through the LangFlow interface.
